Abstract

13

The accelerated exploration and engineering of nucleotide sequences are directed towards quantum

14

mechanics and their intrinsic entanglements, implementing the qubits states, including the

15

development of algorithms. The production rate of biological sequencing data has increased to

16

approximately 1 Gb/h, but the ability to analyse these data has not kept pace due to complexity

17

issues and the limitations of classic computing. Despite its own challenges, quantum computing

18

offers a potential solution for analysing biological data and extracting relevant information. Here,

19

we developed and implemented a quantum algorithm that drives searches for genetic information.

20

Our results demonstrated that two codes written based on quantum computing language could

21

precisely search for a target sequence with 50 nucleotides in a DNA sequence database with up to

22

3022 nucleotides, building a synthetic structure called Quantum Biological Blocks (BioBloQu)

23

inside a minimal JCVI-syn3.0 cells. Our algorithm constitutes a unique starting point for

24

developing a more sophisticated model for the manipulation of data. This tool could be exploited

25

for quantum-enhanced design, building synthetic genomes with desirable traits from the bottom

26

up and exploiting genetic big data. Enhancing the algorithm and expanding device availability are

27

significant targets for accelerating searches and gathering specific biodiversity features for

28

research and applications.

Introduction

30

The intersection of quantum theory and biology has intrigued researchers for over a century,

31

suggesting a fundamental limit to our understanding of life through the lens of atomic structures. 1

32

The advent of quantum mechanical computers in the early 1980s 2 set the stage for ground-breaking

33

advances, culminating in the late 1980s and early 1990s with pioneering descriptions 3-7 that were

34

aimed at solving problems that had previously been considered intractable with classic algorithms.

35

In 1996, Grover introduced a quantum algorithm that revolutionized database searches, resulting

36

in a remarkable reduction in complexity from O(N) to O(√N); however, the practical applications

37

of this algorithm remain limited by the operational demands of large databases.

38

In the coming years, quantum simulations are expected to make significant advances in areas

39

such as quantum chemistry and high-temperature superconductivity. The community is making

40

progress, but the creation of noise-resistant quantum computers that can handle a variety of

41

problems will likely take another 10 to 15 years. The current challenges include protecting the

42

delicate states of quantum bits (qubits) from errors and unwanted environmental disturbances. This

43

gap between the theoretical potential and the current technological capabilities underscores the

44

transformative promise of quantum computing, particularly in biological research 8. According to

45

Pan8, realistic expectations regarding advances in quantum computing are needed since large

46

companies are claiming to offer quantum computing services when they are limited to small-scale

47

algorithms.

48

Quantum computers operate using quantum bits (qubits), which, unlike classic bits, can exist in

49

multiple states simultaneously because of superposition. The phenomenon of entanglement

50

enables interdependencies between qubit states, facilitating faster computations 9-11. Importantly,

51

quantum computers should not be seen solely as an evolutionary successor of classic systems 12;

52

instead, they excel at solving specific, complex problems, whereas classic systems remain optimal

53

for other tasks13.

54

Quantum computing opens new avenues for biological research that could lead to breakthroughs

55

in medicine14, biotechnology15,16, and our understanding of life itself17 and evolution18. Currently,

56

quantum computing approaches, with their intrinsic and unique capabilities, offer promising

57

solutions for the acceleration, prospection and manipulation of nucleotide sequences with the aim

58

of discovering specific and innovative traits in genomics 19-23. For a broader perspective on

59

quantum computing in biology, several articles have been published 15,24-33. However, the lack of

60

sufficient quantum algorithms that are tailored to computational biology challenges hinders the

61

potential of quantum computing to accelerate genetic data processing and manipulation processes

62

in this field9,10,12,13,34-44.

63

A quantum search conducted using Grover's algorithm showed the explicit process of

64

constructing a gate, which was programmed using Qibo for N = 8 and M = 2. While the classic

65

algorithm required N + M queries in the worst case, the quantum algorithm found the solution with

66

only one or two queries, demonstrating an improvement in execution time. However, a limitation

67

of the algorithm is that N must be significantly greater than M. In addition, studies have included

68

generalized the algorithm to the fourth dimension to search for codons in DNA sequences using

69

quarts (4-dimensional qudits) and modified the alphabet to include A, C, G, and U 37. In this

70

context, efforts to develop new quantum algorithms form a key challenge in quantum information

71

technology, which, in turn, demands the combined expertise of the quantum physics and

72

computational biology communities26.

73

Owing to hardware requirements, our study was performed on a 5-qubit IBM cloud machine and

74

was limited to a subset of a gene sequence containing four nucleotides 12. We developed and

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.05.02.651535; this version posted May 7, 2025. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

75

implemented two codes that apply quantum algorithms to optimize large-scale genetic sequence

76

analyses using 127 qubits derived from the IBM simulator. The present code contributes to the

77

implementation of a novel quantum computing algorithm for a specific DNA sequence (the "target

78

sequence") in a genetic sequence database and builds a functional “bioblock” that we call

79

BioBloQu in a region of the minimal cell genome (JCVI-syn3). In this work, we extended the

80

applicability of the Grover algorithm by developing and implementing an algorithm that is capable

81

of handling more complex problems, such as searching DNA nucleotide sequences (A, T, G, and

82

C), instead of binary symbols. The diffusion operator remained unchanged, but the oracle was

83

modified to adapt to and operate on ququarts, enabling the algorithm to be efficiently implemented

84

and conduct searches within a larger and more complex dataset of synthetic structures.

85

Results

86

Searching for the sequence of interest using QuBio.py code

87

The primary objective of the quantum simulation conducted using Qubio.py was to evaluate the

88

effectiveness of Grover's algorithm in terms of identifying specific DNA sequences with 50

89

nucleotides (target sequences) within a genetic database (3022 nucleotides). The target DNA

90

sequence was selected based on its relevance to ongoing gene identification research; in this case,

91

a conserved functional domain of the Cas9-like nucleotide sequence found in Brazilian biomes

92

was employed.

93

This quantum code performs nucleotide sequence comparisons, allowing a mismatch rate of up

94

to 30%. This approach differs from BLAST45, which is a widely utilized tool for sequence

95

alignment that, although efficient, is predominantly classical. It allows up to 30% differences

96

between the compared sequences, which can be useful in contexts where sequence variations are

97

expected, such as in evolution studies or analyses of homologous genes. Although BLASTN also

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.05.02.651535; this version posted May 7, 2025. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

98

identifies similar sequences, the way it calculates similarity values and addresses mismatches is

99

more complex, considering factors such as gap penalties and different forms of similarity.

100

Focused on applications where speed and tolerance to variations are paramount, the utilized

101

method can be particularly useful in projects that require rapid sequence analyses with a focus on

102

general similarities.

103

Our code represents an interesting advance regarding the application of quantum computing to

104

sequence comparisons, allowing for fast and flexible analyses in contexts where tolerance to

105

mismatches is desirable. This innovative approach can complement the classic tools, offering new

106

perspectives for genomic research.

107

The simulation and implementation stages were performed on the IBM Quantum Experience

108

platform, which used a quantum processor with 127 qubits. The Grover's algorithm-based code

109

was configured with a search space corresponding to a genetic database sequence consisting of

110

3022 nucleotides from a Brazilian metagenome sequence database. On the IBM simulator, the

111

algorithm completed in 1 second, whereas on the real IBM quantum computer, it took slightly

112

longer, at 6 seconds with 1 iteration. This difference was expected because of the additional

113

overhead and complexity involved in executing the algorithm on physical quantum hardware

114

relative to a simulated environment. In the IBM simulator, the numbers of tested iterations were

115

1, 10, 20, 50 and 100, which ensured that the probability of observing the correct result was

116

maximized and provided a robust comparison. Overall, the real quantum computer was slightly

117

slower but still efficiently handled the same sequence size and number of shots as the simulator

118

did, indicating its practical applicability for use in such bioinformatics tasks. The results of the

119

tests are summarized in Table 1.

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.05.02.651535; this version posted May 7, 2025. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

120

Additionally, by performing tests with different numbers of iterations (Fig. 1), it was possible to

121

verify an oscillation pattern in the final probability of the sequence being found in the database.

122

With one, 10, 20, 50 and 100 iterations, the oscillation in the probability continued in the pattern

123

between 0.26 and 0.28 (26-28%) probabilities of the sequence being found by the code based on

124

Grover's algorithm.

125

We also tested how the code behaved by changing only 15 nucleotides in the target sequence

126

(30% mismatch rate) and not modifying them in the database. The results indicate that the

127

algorithm was sensitive to this specific change. When we changed more than 15 nucleotides, we

128

observed a sequence finding probability equal to zero (Fig. 2).

129

Additionally, we performed a simulation to compare the predicted processing times using a

130

quantum computer with various qubit counts (150, 200, 250, and 300 qubits) and a traditional

131

server with 100 threads. These predictions were made for target sequences consisting of 100, 200,

132

and 300 base pairs via the real processing times obtained from a 100-qubit quantum computer and

133

a 100-thread server with 50 base pairs as references. The search was conducted on a 1-petabyte

134

database with a reference sequence of 3 kb. The results indicate that, as expected, increasing the

135

number of qubits significantly reduced the processing time. For example, processing a sequence

136

of 100 base pairs required 0.68 hours with 100 qubits, whereas the same task was completed in

137

only 0.17 hours with 300 qubits. Similarly, for a 300-bp sequence, the time requirement decreased

138

from 2.04 hours with 100 qubits to 0.51 hours with 300 qubits. In comparison, the server with 100

139

threads required 0.448, 1.024, and 1.6 hours to process 100, 200, and 300 base pairs, respectively

140

(Fig. 3).

141

These results suggest that quantum computing offers substantial processing efficiency

142

improvements, particularly as the sequence length increases, making it a promising solution for

143

handling large-scale metagenomic data.

144

Finding a scar in the minimal M. mycoides JCVI-Syn3 cell and building functional biological

145

blocks

146

New genes identified in metagenome studies, as exemplified above with Cas9 from Brazilian

147

biomes, can be sources of new functions and attributes for genetically modified or even synthetic

148

organisms. Therefore, quantum computing-based tools that assemble genes and detect optimal

149

insertion sites will be valuable techniques for guiding rational genome editing processes or even

150

the de novo design of completely synthetic genomes. In that context, we developed a second code

151

based on Grover’s algorithm to execute these tasks.

152

We worked with sequences acquired from the minimized M. mycoides JCVI-Syn3 genome given

153

its importance as one of the main landmarks in synthetic biology. The first breakthrough regarding

154

the development of this minimal cell was the creation of M. mycoides JCVI-Syn1.0, which was

155

the first cell to be controlled by a genome that was completely chemically synthesized in the

156

laboratory46. This strain then served as a chassis for studies in the identification of essential genes

157

and the removal of nonessential genes to generate a minimized version of the original genome,

158

resulting in M. mycoides JCVI-Syn3, which included less than 50% of its parental genome 17.

159

Our second code was first used to identify the unique sequence present in Syn-3B and resulting

160

from the deletion of the nonessential gene mmsyn1_0531, which was originally present between

161

the essential genes mmsyn1_0530 and rrl in Syn-1.0. This new gene organization scheme

162

generated a new sequence that can be seen as a scar marking the deletion site of a nonessential

163

gene (Fig. 4). This region could be an interesting insertion site for an exogenous gene, since there

164

was no risk of disrupting an existing transcriptional unit. Additionally, given their originally distant

165

positions, suggesting independent regulation for each gene, a reduced degree of structural

166

interference with gene expression was expected.

167

Following the identification of a good insertion site, the code then assembled a genetic structure

168

with important components to create a transcriptional unit (with a promoter, an RBS, a protein

169

sequence and a terminator). The assembled structure was named a BioBloQu, with each individual

170

part described as geneQuantum (Fig. 5).

171

The generation of biological blocks for the construction process, which we denote as the

172

BioBloQu of a synthetic sequence of interest using the search performed in step 1 with QuBio.py,

173

included the addition of a promoter sequence, an RBS, the sequence of the enzyme of interest and

174

a terminator (which was able to add repressor and enhancer sequences).

175

This is a visual representation of the power of quantum computing for constructing genetic blocks

176

inspired by BioBricksTM. This approach not only streamlines the design process but also enhances

177

the potential for creating innovative biological systems. As quantum technologies continue to

178

advance, their applications in synthetic biology promise to revolutionize our ability to engineer

179

life and tackle complex biological challenges.

180

This new genetic structure replaced the scar that was initially identified by the code, generating

181

a modified minimal cell with the capacity to possibly secrete the protein that was present in the

182

designed BioBloQu (Fig. 6).

183

The addition of these components suggests an effort to modify or improve the functionality of

184

the genome, possibly aimed at engineering new phenotypic traits or optimizing metabolic

185

processes. In this way, quantum computing and the construction and optimization of genetic

186

sequences are possible. This approach enables the exploration of genetic combinations that are

187

computationally infeasible with the traditional techniques, highlighting the intersection of

188

biotechnology with quantum computing. This fact illustrates a transformation in the genome of

189

Mycoplasma mycoides and emphasizes the potential of methods based on quantum computing for

190

use in genetic engineering scenarios. It serves as an example of how synthetic biology can be

191

enhanced by emerging technologies, offering new possibilities for research and applications in

192

diverse fields, such as agriculture and biofuels.

193

Discussion

194

Some biomedical scientists are exploring how quantum computing can enhance algorithms and

195

machine learning methods in various biological fields, such as protein design. As biologists adopt

196

this technology, they seek to understand its underlying mechanisms and determine when classic

197

computers are sufficient22.

198

Several approaches have been proposed to optimize DNA sequence searches, from classic

199

algorithms based on string comparisons to preliminary quantum implementations that seek to

200

exploit quantum superposition and interference. However, gaps remain regarding the practical

201

applications of these methods in large genomic databases.

202

Estimating the universal prior distribution is essential for inferring the algorithmic structure of

203

data and discovering causal generative models. Although these metrics are not computable, they

204

can be approximated by limiting the time and memory resources consumed by the utilized

205

computational model. However, the exponential scaling of potential automata makes them

206

intractable on classic computers, particularly for complex cases. Owing to their unstructured

207

outputs and computational irreducibility, traditional heuristics cannot approximate these

208

computations. A quantum circuit framework was proposed in this study to estimate the universal

209

distribution by simulating the superposition of programs for resource-bounded automata. This

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.05.02.651535; this version posted May 7, 2025. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

210

approach offers a quantum resource complexity level with linear complexity concerning the data

211

size, achieving a polynomial speedup over the classic exhaustive methods. Thus, the exploration

212

of program-output relationships represents a promising avenue for accelerating quantum searches,

213

with specific data properties inferred from the universal distribution in the quantum superposition

214

task28.

215

De39 introduced new formulations for RNA structures by utilizing quantum pattern recognition

216

and the quantum Hamming distance within Grover’s framework, extracting linear regions from

217

these complex forms. To maximize the achievable quantum speedup, methods have been

218

developed for concatenating different linearized segments of RNA structures into longer

219

sequences. The mechanism was simulated using IBM’s Qiskit quantum simulator by employing

220

RNA examples acquired from GenBank and mirBase. Iteration complexity comparisons

221

demonstrated the potential for quadratic speedups in quantum computing over the classic methods,

222

and simulation results indicated high search accuracy. These results suggest that future quantum

223

search methods could significantly accelerate the genome sequencing process as quantum

224

computers become more widely adopted. Further research should investigate the effects of

225

decoherence on detection accuracy and assess the computational demands of each iteration on

226

actual quantum hardware.

227

Kösoglu-Kind et al.12 examined how genetic information is encoded in nucleotide sequences and

228

identified it through comparative analyses. Variations can occur at the nucleotide level or

229

collectively due to recombination or deletion. Detecting these differences is essential for biology

230

and medicine but requires significant classical computing power due to genomic complexity. To

231

address this issue, the authors proposed the use of flexible representations of quantum images

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.05.02.651535; this version posted May 7, 2025. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

232

(FRQIs) for sequence analysis purposes, enabling detailed comparisons and improving the

233

detection accuracy achieved for subtle genetic variations.

234

The potential of quantum computing to speed up the discovery of specific and innovative traits

235

from big nucleotide sequence data is immense. By providing unparalleled processing power,

236

enhancing the precision of trait discovery, optimizing genetic algorithms, integrating with AI, and

237

enabling real-time analyses, quantum computing could revolutionize how we approach genomics

238

and trait development47. As this technology matures, it promises to unlock new possibilities in

239

biotechnology, agriculture, and medicine, paving the way for ground-breaking innovations that

240

could reshape our understanding of life48,49.

241

After analysing the comparative simulation of the predicted processing times using a quantum

242

computer and our robust classic computer server with 100 threads (Fig. 3), the results suggested

243

that quantum computing offers substantial improvements in processing efficiency, particularly as

244

the sequence length increases, making it a promising solution for handling large-scale

245

metagenomic data. Therefore, to match our server with 100 processing threads, the quantum

246

computer needed approximately 150 available qubits. IBM's quantum computer currently has 400

247

qubits, but less than 200 of them are available for use in either simulations or as real quantum

248

units50. Even at a smaller scale, quantum computing can provide efficiency advantages as the

249

number of base pairs contained in the target sequence increases. The use of a greater number of

250

qubits (such as 250 or 300) resulted in processing times that were significantly lower than those

251

of classic computing, suggesting that quantum computing may be more suitable for problems

252

requiring high computational power. The representation of classic computing exhibits a linear

253

increase in processing time, indicating that as the volume of data increases, classic computing may

254

become impractical for tasks that demand intensive processing steps. These observations highlight

255

the potential of quantum computing to transform fields that require the analysis of large amounts

256

of data, such as bioinformatics, molecular modelling, and other scientific applications. Challenges

257

remain, and there is a long way to go before quantum computing becomes established, and we are

258

working in parallel with this progress to maximize its capabilities and expand its achievements

259

within biology and biotechnology.

260

Here, the use of one iteration is sufficient for the objective and demands less time and

261

computational power, as it takes approximately one second for one iteration and 49 seconds for

262

100 iterations. Increasing the number of iterations in a quantum search algorithm can lead to a

263

decrease in the probability of finding the target, which can be attributed to several factors that are

264

related to the nature of quantum algorithms.

265

According to Batra et al.14, algorithms can potentially process large datasets more efficiently,

266

reducing the time required for drug discovery processes. The use of quantum computing can lead

267

to more accurate molecular property predictions, facilitating the identification of promising drug

268

candidates. However, their paper also had several limitations. The current state of quantum

269

computing hardware is still in its infancy, which limits the practical implementations of quantum

270

machine learning algorithms in real-world drug discovery scenarios.

271

The study published by Rodríguez37, which also used the approach employed in our code,

272

exemplified the trade-offs between computational complexity and algorithmic effectiveness, since

273

the practical results obtained here (100 iterations, 0.28 probability, and 48 seconds) demonstrate

274

such complexity. This analysis can be useful for future optimizations, enabling the exploration of

275

different configurations of quantum circuits to improve the efficiency of the algorithm in similar

276

contexts31,51.

277

Studies attempting to generate biological blocks using quantum computing have not yet been

278

reported, and the present study aimed to explore this possibility because quantum computing and

279

synthetic biology are on the rise. Furthermore, the need to quickly and effectively explore large

280

datasets to accelerate and sensitize the construction of biological building blocks is of great interest

281

in the context of biotechnology, especially genetic and biological systems engineering.

282

The discussion presented here encapsulates a promising and innovative frontier at the intersection

of quantum computing and biological sciences, particularly in the domains of genomics and

284

genetic engineering. As researchers increasingly explore the applications of quantum algorithms

285

for solving complex biological problems, it becomes clear that significant advances can be

286

achieved, thereby addressing long-standing challenges in these fields. First, the potential of

287

quantum computing to improve DNA sequence analysis and protein design algorithms cannot be

288

overstated. The ability to leverage quantum superposition and interference offers a paradigm shift

289

in terms of how we process biological data. The traditional computational methods often struggle

290

with the exponential complexity of genomic information, making them unsuitable for large-scale

291

analyses. Owing to its inherent ability to simultaneously process vast datasets, quantum computing

292

presents a viable solution to these challenges. The existing frameworks, such as the quantum

293

circuit approach for estimating universal distributions and the use of quantum pattern recognition

294

in RNA structure analyses, exemplify the innovative strategies that are being developed to

295

effectively harness this technology.

296

Furthermore, the findings derived from recent studies, including those published by De 39 and

297

Kösoglu-Kind et al.12, highlight the feasibility of achieving substantial speedups in genetic

298

analyses through quantum computing. The potential for attaining quadratic and polynomial

299

speedups relative to the classic methods suggests that quantum technologies could significantly

300

reduce the time required for genome sequencing and variant detection. This speedup is particularly

301

crucial as the volume of genomic data continues to grow exponentially, driven by advances in

302

sequencing technologies and the growing interest in personalized medicine.

303

Here, our study contributes to the small-scale assessment of the possibility of accelerating applied

304

analyses with real genomic data and the perspective of advancing quantum computing in the

305

biological sciences. It is a way to not only keep up with the current hype but also to follow the

306

evolution of a science that, despite being an emerging field, is extremely important for the large

307

volume of biological data that will need to be processed in the future.

308

In addition, the integration of quantum computing with artificial intelligence represents an

309

attractive avenue for future research. By optimizing genetic algorithms and facilitating real-time

310

data analyses, quantum computing can revolutionize trait discovery processes in agriculture and

311

biotechnology. The potential to accelerate the identification of beneficial traits and increase crop

312

resilience can generate significant benefits in terms of food security and sustainability. As the

313

world faces urgent challenges such as climate change and population growth, the ability to

314

innovate agricultural practices through quantum-enabled solutions has become increasingly vital.

315

Despite these promising advances, it is essential to recognize the challenges that remain regarding

316

the practical implementation of quantum computing in real-world biological applications. The

317

current state of quantum hardware is still evolving, and qubit availability and coherence time

318

limitations represent significant obstacles. As researchers work to develop more robust and

319

scalable quantum systems, the path to practical applications in biology and genetic engineering

320

will become clearer.

321

In conclusion, this research represents a significant contribution to the field of applying quantum

322

computing to biology and genetic engineering. The innovative approaches discussed herein

323

provide a foundation for further exploration and experimentation, illuminating the potential of

324

quantum technologies to transform our understanding of complex biological systems. As we

325

advance in this exciting domain, it is imperative that we continue to foster interdisciplinary

326

collaboration, bridging the gap between quantum computing and the biological sciences. Such

327

synergy will undoubtedly lead to ground-breaking discoveries and innovations, reshaping the

328

biotechnology landscape and offering new solutions to some of the most pressing challenges in

329

healthcare, agriculture and beyond. The future of quantum computing in biology is immensely

330

promising, and continued explorations of its capabilities will be the key to unlocking new frontiers

331

in science and technology.

Methods

499

The diagram below (Fig. 7) provides a high-level overview of the quantum Qubio.py code

500

developed in-house and designed for genetic sequence analyses using Grover's algorithm on a

501

quantum computing cloud platform. This algorithm is well suited for bioinformatics applications,

502

specifically in the context of sequence searches within large databases, because it provides a

503

quadratic speedup over the classic search algorithms, allowing for the handling of genomic data

504

with an immense scale. While the classic search methods require O(N) comparisons, where N is

505

the size of the database, Grover's algorithm reduces this number to O(√N)52. The process begins

506

with two main inputs, the target DNA sequence and the database sequence, where the

507

superposition of quantum states allows multiple comparisons to occur simultaneously. The target

508

DNA sequence is the specific genetic sequence of interest that needs to be analysed. This could be

509

a particular gene or segment related to a specific trait. On the other hand, the database sequence

510

represents a collection of genetic sequences stored in a database. These sequences may come from

511

various sources, such as whole genomes, gene libraries, or databases of genetic variations 12.

512

Once the data are prepared, the core of the process involves applying Grover's algorithm, which

513

is a quantum algorithm that was designed for efficiently searching unsorted databases. By

514

leveraging quantum computing, Grover's algorithm significantly speeds up the process of

searching for the target sequence within the database relative to the classic methods, reducing the

516

number of required comparisons. The execution of Qubio.py takes place on a quantum computing

517

cloud platform.

518

After the algorithm runs, the results of the analysis are obtained. These results indicate the

519

presence or location of the target sequence within the database, which is then processed to extract

520

meaningful insights. In scientific research, understanding and analysing genetic sequences can

521

lead to insights into biological mechanisms, the study of genetic diseases, and the development of

522

new therapies and bioactive molecules. In agriculture, genetic analyses can help identify the genes

523

that are responsible for desirable plant traits, such as disease resistance, productivity, and product

524

quality. Additionally, genetic analyses can be used in environmental monitoring cases to track

525

biodiversity and assess the health of ecosystems by detecting and monitoring species and genetic

526

variations.

527

This code implements Grover's algorithm to efficiently search for a specific target sequence

528

within a database of DNA sequences. By leveraging Grover's transformation, which is represented

529

mathematically by matrices, the algorithm amplifies the probability of locating the desired

530

sequence.

531

Sequence definition

532

To define the short-length target sequence (50 bp), a protein sequence isolated from the

533

Brazilian biomes metagenome project was explored and analysed in terms of its functional domain.

534

Its most genetically conserved portion was highlighted and filtered to serve as a search target (Fig.

535

8). The chosen protein, Cas9-like nuclease, is involved in the CRISPR/Cas9 system, which has

536

several advantages, such as its high editing efficiency, its ease of operation, its cost-effectiveness,

537

and the diversity of its recognition sites. It can be used to edit the human genome for treating

538

genetic defects or illnesses caused by gene mutations. It can also edit plant genes to create more

539

resilient plants. Furthermore, the CRISPR/Cas9 editing technology offers the possibility of

540

eliminating pathogens such as bacteria and viruses, which could completely cure infectious

541

diseases53.

Qubio.py code and quantum circuit

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.05.02.651535; this version posted May 7, 2025. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

543

According to the reported data, Grover's algorithm 54 is the most appropriate algorithm for

544

performing searches in a quantum environment. In the circuit of this algorithm, each qubit is input,

545

|0> and |1> possess equal superposition probabilities, and this qubit passes, or each element is

546

searched. The output generates the results. This superposition is achieved via the Hadamard

547

transformation, enabling the qubit to explore multiple states simultaneously, which is a key feature

548

for exploiting quantum parallelism. Each pass through the algorithm incrementally increases the

549

probability of finding the correct result, enhancing the efficiency beyond that of the classic search

550

methods. The representation of the quantum circuit for the target sequence of 50 nucleotides can

551

be observed in Fig. S1, as along with the code used to generate it. Our code allows the search to

552

be performed with up to a 30% mismatch rate, meaning that the similarity between the target

553

sequence and the database sequence is 70%. In practical terms, if the query sequence and the

554

database sequence have 100 nucleotides, a similarity of 70% indicates that 70 nucleotides are

555

identical or very similar, whereas 30 nucleotides differ. Depending on the context of the search, a

556

similarity of 70% may be sufficient for inferring homologies but may require an additional

557

analysis.

558

Grover algorithm

559

The oracle implementation uses a series of control-X gates (CX gates) to label qubits by

560

comparing the input and target sequences. The Grover diffusion operator, (U_G), amplifies the

561

probability of obtaining the correct answer by reflecting the quantum state about the average of all

562

the superposed states. Mathematically, the Grover transformation is represented as follows:

563

U_G = (2|s⟩⟨s|) - I

564

where (s) represents the initial state of the uniform superposition process and (I) is the identity

565

matrix. This transformation iterates multiple times to maximize the amplitude of the desired

566

quantum state. The probability (P_n) of finding the target sequence after (n) iterations of Grover’s

567

transformation is given by

568

P_n = sin²((2n+1)θ)

569

where θ is the angle between the initial state |s⟩ and the target state |w⟩, which encodes the

570

solution in the Hilbert space. After a sufficient number of iterations, the superposition collapses

571

into the target state, and the binary result is decoded to retrieve the target sequence. The binary

572

result is then converted back to the corresponding nucleotide sequence, and the result

573

corresponding to the target sequence is checked.

574

Hadamard transformation

575

This function implements the core logic of Grover’s algorithm. It begins by initializing a

576

quantum circuit with numerous qubits (double the length of the target sequence to be searched).

577

Hadamard gates are applied to create an initial superposition across all possible states. The oracle

578

function is then executed to mark the target sequence. The Grover transformation is repeatedly

579

applied to amplify the probability of measuring the correct target sequence. The final step involves

580

measuring the quantum state and analysing the results to determine the probability of successfully

581

identifying the target sequence.

582
583

The Grover transformation can be mathematically represented by the transformation matrix
U_G, which is defined as shown below:

584

UG=2∣ψ⟩⟨ψ∣−I

585

The Grover transformation, UG=2∣ψ⟩⟨ψ∣−I, operates by reflecting the current quantum state

586

over the average of all possible states, where ∣ψ⟩ is the initial state of the uniform superposition

587

process, ⟨ψ∣ is its conjugate transpose, and I is the identity matrix.

588

Oracle function

589

The oracle function applies the oracle operation to the quantum circuit and checks whether the

590

current measurement matches the target sequence. The operation is mathematically represented by

591

the transformation matrix U_f, which is defined as follows:

592

U_f |x⟩ |y⟩ = |x⟩ |y ⊕ f(x)⟩

593

In this equation, (x) represents the qubits encoding the input (e.g., the DNA sequence in a

594

bioinformatics application), whereas (y) denotes the label qubit. The function f(x) returns a value

595

of 1 if the input state (x) matches the target sequence and 0 otherwise. The oracle is implemented

596

using CX gates, which apply the appropriate transformation by evaluating the input and target

597

sequences. This process flags the matching state without collapsing the quantum superposition.

598

Measuring qubits

599

We implemented Grover’s algorithm on real quantum hardware and compared the results with

600

those of classic simulation schemes. The quantum simulations were performed using the Qiskit

601

framework, leveraging the Qiskit Aer simulator for up to 100 qubits. Real quantum hardware tests

602

were conducted on IBM Cloud’s quantum systems, where access was constrained by both time

603

(ten-minute sessions) and the number of qubits required just for the first code, Qubio.py.

604

Despite these constraints, the quantum implementation demonstrated the ability of the

605

algorithm to efficiently identify target sequences with far fewer comparisons than that required by

606

the classic algorithms. By running the simulations via Google Colab, which hosts the Qubio.py

607

code, we highlighted the potential advantages of quantum-based algorithms in scaling up

608

computational tasks, even in bioinformatics applications.

609

Scars and the BioBloQu code

610
611

To search for scar sequences and insert genetic blocks using quantum computing, the target
sequences and the database sequence were defined as follows.

612

Two predefined sequences (left end: AAAATCTGTCATAAATTATC; right end:

613

ATTATTCTCCTTTCTTTAGT) from a specific essential gene in a determined region of the

614

minimal genome of M. mycoides JCVI-Syn3 (3906 nucleotides) were analysed. Part of the minimal

615

cell genome was used as a database for the search. The target sequences were represented as binary

616

vectors, where each nucleotide was mapped to a quantum state: adenine (A) corresponded to state

617

|1⟩, cytosine (C) corresponded to a superposition state, guanine (G) corresponded to a combination

618

of |1⟩ and |0⟩, and thymine (T) corresponded to |0⟩. The quantum circuit was constructed using the

619

QuantumCircuit class, where Hadamard operations and controlled gates were applied to prepare

620

the superposition and perform the search.

621

The insertion of the genetic block was accomplished by identifying the position of the scar in

622

the database sequence and replacing it with the BioBloQu block. The circuit was then simulated

623

using the Qiskit backend, where measuring the qubits resulted in counts that represented the

624

probabilities of finding the target sequences.

625

All the codes were run in the IBM simulation environment via Jupyter notebooks and Google

626

Colab.

Additional applications

631

While Grover’s algorithm was applied to the field of bioinformatics in our study, the quantum

632

search algorithm can be adapted for solving broader scientific challenges. For example, it could

633

be used to identify patterns in astrobiology datasets or search for signals in massive astronomical

634

data. As quantum computing technology matures, Grover’s algorithm has the potential to

635

overcome the computational limitations that were previously faced by classic systems.

636

Quantum searches can also enable the identification of novel traits within genetic sequences

637

that were previously inaccessible due to computational resource constraints. This could

638

revolutionize fields such as genomics, pharmaceuticals, agriculture, and environmental science,

639

driving innovation forwards across a variety of disciplines. Grover’s algorithm offers a

640

transformative approach for solving computational search problems, providing a quadratic

641

speedup over the classic methods. Quantum computing promises to revolutionize domains such as

642

computational biology, but significant challenges remain in terms of hardware scalability and the

643

development of domain-specific quantum algorithms. Collaborative efforts between quantum

644

physicists and computational scientists will be essential for overcoming these challenges, pushing

645

quantum technology beyond the constraints of classic systems.
