# Biological Hypercomputing Research Platform #

## Overview
This project explores cross-phenomenon computational breakthroughs by integrating biological, quantum, and topological paradigms. It provides a modular Python framework for simulating, analyzing, and integrating phenomena such as cellular networks, molecular noise, genetic circuits, metabolism, self-organization, swarm intelligence, evolutionary adaptation, quantum biology, and resource constraints.

## Weyltronics Section
The **Weyltronics** module introduces simulation and integration capabilities for theoretical hardware based on Weyl semimetals and topological materials. These materials exhibit exotic quantum properties, such as robust, dissipationless edge states and chiral anomaly effects, which are promising for quantum-enhanced, noise-resilient, and biologically integrated computing.

### Key Features
- **Core Simulation**: Classes for Weyl semimetal systems, topological protection, and chiral anomaly effects.
- **Materials Database**: Properties and optimization of Weyl semimetal and bio-hybrid materials.
- **Quantum Transport**: Simulation of quantum transport, edge currents, and noise resilience.
- **Quantum-Bio Interfaces**: Abstract and concrete classes for coupling biological signals with quantum states.
- **Topological Analysis**: Tools for calculating invariants (Chern number, Berry curvature, Z2) and phase diagrams.
- **Chiral Effects**: Models for chiral anomaly-induced computation and optimization.
- **Synergy Integrations**: Integration with other biological phenomena (noise, cellular networks, genetic circuits, metabolism) for hybrid computing.
- **Testing & Examples**: Unit tests and example scripts for simulation, visualization, and quantum-bio interface demonstrations.
