Weyltronics refers to theoretical hardware based on Weyl semimetals and topological materials, which exhibit exotic quantum properties such as robust, dissipationless edge states and chiral anomaly effects. In the context of your project, Weyltronic hardware could provide:

Ultra-fast, low-energy information transport via topologically protected states.
Robustness to noise and defects, aligning with the noise-enhanced and quantum-protected paradigms in your framework.
Potential for new types of quantum-bio interfaces, enabling hybrid biological-quantum computation.
Weyltronics is speculative but aligns well with the vision of scale-adaptive, noise-resilient, and quantum-enhanced biological hypercomputing described in your project.
